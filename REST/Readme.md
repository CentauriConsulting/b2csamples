##REST APIs used by my sample IEF policies

These APIs are referenced from the various [IEF policies](https://github.com/mrochon/b2csamples/tree/master/Policies).

The REST API project used by the multi-tenant sample policies have been been moved to 
[a separate repo](https://github.com/mrochon/b2c-mt-rest) to enable use of 
[scripts](https://github.com/mrochon/b2csamples/tree/master/Scripts/MultiTenant) to deploy it to any Azure subscription.
